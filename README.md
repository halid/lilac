lilac configurator for Nagios
=====

This is the official github repository for the Lilac Configurator tool for Nagios.  Lilac features some of the following tools:

 * Strong templates which extends beyong the power of regular Nagios Templating
 * Autodisovery powered by NMAP
 * Background exporting of large jobs
 * Backup previous configuration snapshots
 * Import form existing Nagios 2.x and Nagios 3.x configuration formats

This codebase has not been updated since 2011.  However, if interest shows, I will continue development and correct any bugs reported.
